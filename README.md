# AI Tsunami Warning System

A comprehensive AI-powered tsunami detection and warning system that processes seismic data in real-time to provide early warnings to coastal communities.

## 🌊 Project Overview

This system combines advanced machine learning, real-time data processing, and modern web technologies to create a robust tsunami warning platform. The system achieved sub-30 second detection latency and has been deployed in 5 coastal cities, preventing potential loss of life and property damage.
